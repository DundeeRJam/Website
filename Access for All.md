# Access for All Policy

## Introduction
At Dundee RJam, we believe that our show and tell, worskshops and talks should be accessible to **everyone**. We recognise that 
there are some of our younger visitors and a few adults too that have special educational needs, but have an interest in 
Raspberry Pi's, programming and computing.

For exapmle, these needs may arise from the visitor being on the autistic spectrum. Many of which have been assessed 
professionally and recieve help at school or college and its only right that we should, where possible attend to their needs 
too. 

We have therfore decided to come up with a list of actions that we will take at each of our Jams to accomodate these visitors. 
These actions and policies will relate specifically to the younger visitors, but do apply to adults with special educational 
needs as well.

## Actions and Policies
1. **We will ask**, when a ticket is booked if any of the visitors in the group have special educational needs that we should be aware of. This will allow us to address their needs specifically.
2. **For each workshop session**, we will get a breakdown of what will be happening in that session. This will enable us to give an outline of what is going to happen during the session so that visitors are better prepared.
3. **At the time of booking on workshops**, we will make is as cl;ear as possible to the working arrangements expected of visitors. Normal workshop arrangement is that visitors work 2 per Raspberry Pi workstation. This is not always appropriate to some visitors. For instance, a parent/carer may chose to book one ticket for themselves so that they can assist their child.
4. **Where visitors with special needs have booked on workshops**, we will ask them if they need to sit somewhere specific within the room. Seats will them be reserved as necessary.
5. **We would ask that visitors with special educational needs are given support dusring the activity**. We recognise that some visitors with special educational needs may not need fulltime support in this manner. In this case, we do ask the parent or carer remains in the building and that they let one of the workshop helpers know where they will be in case of emergency.
6. **We will notify workshop leaders and assistants** that they have visitors with special educational needs within the room. This should allow them to **a)** be aware of any special needs and **b)** know that they can ask the parent or carer to help.
7. **We will identify which of our talks are suitiable for children in general and we will always try and specify how long talks are**. This should mean that parents and carers will be able to choose which talks to attend based on their child's interests and attention span.
8. **Where possible we will designate part of the venue as a Quiet Area**. This will provide parents/carers with an emergency respite area for when they just need peace and quiet for 10 minutes.
9. **We will ask all show and tell exhibitors to provide an information sheet on their table for visitors to read**. We are aware that some visitors with special educational needs are njot always comfortable asking questions about the project on display. The information sheet will enable them to learn about the exhibit without interacing unless they wish to.
