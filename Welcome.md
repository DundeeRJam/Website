Dundee MakerSpace started running raspberry pi events in 2016. With the first raspberry jam in June. 

There was a good turn out, so we thought we should do more. Plus the raspberry pi foundation are trying to support Jam organisers more and get more jams set up all over.

From 25th of March 2017 Dundee MakerSpace will be running monthly Jams on the 4th Saturday of every month. This will be the first regular running Raspberry Jam in Scotland.

We are going to have some self directed learning tables, some talks and show and tell projects as well as battling robots.
